## 2025-12-01
- Added `fontlift completions <shell>` subcommand powered by `clap_complete`, emitting scripts to stdout for bash/zsh/fish/powershell/elvish.
- New test `completions_include_core_commands` to ensure generated scripts mention core commands.
- Ran `cargo test --workspace` (pass).
- Added CLI aliases (`l/i/u/rm/c`) and mapped clap parse errors to legacy exit codes (0 for help/version, 1 otherwise).
- Added tests for alias coverage and exit-code mapping; `cargo test --workspace` passes.
- Removed `build-macos.sh`; unified on `build.sh` to eliminate shell completion ambiguity (`./build` now resolves uniquely).
- Updated PLAN/TODO references to reflect single build script.
- Added core `protection` helpers for system font detection and deterministic deduplication; wired CLI list rendering to use shared dedupe logic and reused protection checks in macOS manager.
- New core tests for protection/dedup helpers; all crates pass `cargo test --workspace`.
- Extended CLI ergonomics: batch file/dir install/uninstall/remove support, global `--dry-run/--quiet/--verbose` flags, and deterministic input collection.
- Added CLI tests for directory expansion and dry-run no-op behavior; ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo test --workspace` (pass).
- Updated README/USAGE to document multi-file installs and dry-run/quiet/verbose flags; checked off TODO/PLAN items for CLI ergonomics.
- Added PyO3 build.rs to inject macOS dynamic lookup flags; `cargo test --workspace` now succeeds building `fontlift-python`.
- Swapped Python module name to `fontlift._native`, added hatch-vcs-based pyproject with Fire CLI `fontliftpy`, and added Python package scaffolding.
- Introduced release GitHub Action for tag-based releases (wheels + crates) and manual `publish.sh` helper; added hatch-friendly build steps to `build.sh`.
