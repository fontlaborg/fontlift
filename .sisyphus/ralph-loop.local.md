Go through every source code file and every file of documentation included in the project, including technical files like README.md or CHANGELOG.md or TASKS.md. You’re a great writer and explainer. Annotate every source code with docstrings and comments that explain what the file does, what each function/class/method does, how it does it, where in the project it’s used, why it’s useful. Update all documentation. Write in a way that’s educational to the reader. Avoid fluff and hype. Make all the annotations, docstrings, comments, explanations and documentation accurate. NEVER overpromise. Just describe exactly what the code does NOW, not what it might do in future!!! If you find any bugs in the code, DON’T CHANGE ANY PROGRAMMING CODE/LOGIC, report the bugs into ./BUGS.md ! WRITING RULES: Before you start writing, ultrathink about the right structure and narrative. Then write the story, and follow these rules: Lead strong: First line earns attention for what follows. No throat-clearing. Plain language (No jargon, passive voice, or corporate fluff.) Concise (Every sentence must count.) Show, don’t tell (Specific examples over abstractions.) UX matters (Error messages are user experience, make them helpful.) Edit ruthlessly (If rereading is needed, rewrite). Remove: Fluff, bloat, corpo jargon, hype words like "revolutionary". Light, understated humor is allowed with a hint of the personality of Norm Macdonald mixed with Stephen Fry; but clarity wins. Generally follow Stephen King’s writing advice. ULTRAWORK: Deploy a team of 3 agents: Teammate 1 is the Supervisor who analyzes, plans, coordinates, orchestrates the next steps & delegates the work; Teammate 2 is the Writer who performs the writing, and requests research from Researcher if needed; Teammate 3 is the Researcher who performs research inside the codebase to deliver important facts the Writer. Repeat & refine until all is done.  ———— ALSO INTRODUCE ONE FUNCTION, explicitly allow either copying the font files into the fonts folder or just install without copying
